The instructions at http://developer.android.com/training/in-app-billing/preparing-iab-app.html do not quite match up with what is necessary in a libgdx gradle project.

You can use a billing library (like https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-pay), but that may feel like overkill if you are only publishing to the google play store.

So here are some modified steps to prepare your project (from a unix command line) with the standard google billing code as described in the google documentation.

The first step is to add the interface definition to your project.

pushd $PROJECT
mkdir -p android/src/com/android/vending/billing/
cp $ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/play_billing/samples/TrivialDrive/src/com/android/vending/billing/IInAppBillingService.aidl android/src/com/android/vending/billing/
./gradlew android:assembleRelease
popd

If this has been successful, you should find the generated java source in 

$PROJECT/android/build/generated/source/aidl/release/com/android/vending/billing/IInAppBillingService.java

The next step is to add the "utils" from the example TrivialDrive project, and update their package

pushd $PROJECT
mkdir -p android/src/$YOURPROJECTDIR/util
cp $ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/play_billing/samples/TrivialDrive/src/com/example/android/trivialdrivesample/util/* android/src/$YOURPROJECTDIR/util
sed -e 's/com.example.android.trivialdrivesample.util/$YOURPROJECTPACKAGE.util/g' -i'' android/src/$YOURPROJECTDIR/util/*.java
popd

You can check that the magic sed file changing line worked by checking the diff output..

diff -u android/src/$YOURPROJECTDIR/util/ $ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/play_billing/samples/TrivialDrive/src/com/example/android/trivialdrivesample/util/

The only changed lines should be the package declarations.

The project should now be prepared to use the IabHelper.
