# TBD
See the [RoboVM docs](http://www.robovm.org/docs.html) in the meantime. For RoboVM specific questions, head over the the [RoboVM Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robovm).

**Note:** The RoboVM backend is still missing some features. See [Todos](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-robovm/todos.txt) for what still needs to be done. Contributions are always welcome.
